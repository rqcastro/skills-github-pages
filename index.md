I’m Renato Queiroz de Castro, a Senior Project Manager with over two decades of experience driving complex, large-scale projects, especially in the financial services sector. I’ve successfully led cross-functional teams at top-tier institutions like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Deutsche Bank, as well as innovative startups, delivering projects that align business objectives with cutting-edge technology. My expertise spans from traditional software development to emerging fields like data science and web3. I’m particularly skilled at navigating the complexities of global financial landscapes, consistently delivering results on time and within budget. I hold an MBA, a Master’s in Innovation, and certifications in Prince2 and Scrum, which empower me to lead in both Agile and Waterfall environments. Fluent in three languages and expanding my skills in French, I excel in cross-cultural communication and thrive in fast-paced, high-stakes environments.
